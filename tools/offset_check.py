"""Whether short-message speed depends on where buffers and stacks happen to
sit, modulo the 4 KiB page (4 KiB aliasing), and whether that changed.

    python3 tools/offset_check.py [--exe BENCH] [--step BYTES] [--keep DIR]

Run from the fork's root with a bench-hashes checkout beside it
(`../bench-hashes`, or --bench DIR), or pass --exe, a `bench-hashes
build-against` executable. Linux with glibc:
it moves the duo-copy threads' stacks (glibc.rtld.optional_static_tls)
through one whole page in 16-byte steps, the stack's own alignment
(--step for others), and measures a short-message cell set at each (the
main thread's stack: see offsets()).

Why: a caller writes a short message and hashes it at once. When our call
chain's stack accesses share the message's low 12 address bits, the CPU
holds them behind the caller's stores (EPYC 9255: 1.05 to 1.5 ns/B for a
64-byte hash()). Which state a build lands in follows frame sizes, thread
count, environment and allocation history, none of which a relink changes,
so one offset can decide a comparison (bench-hashes #65).

How: a scan (one quick run per offset, reading the bench's printed report),
then a rescan of each cell's few worst offsets, twice more: a slow state
stays slow when measured again, a stray reading does not, so a candidate's
score is the lowest of its three readings. Each cell's best-scoring
candidate is then compared against its best scanned offset by `bench-hashes
regress` on fresh runs, judged as every comparison is (clocks::summary).
Selection and verdict use separate runs; no threshold stands between a
small effect and its confirmation (the i7-12700K's is +9-11% in a window
48 bytes wide, which steps of 64 and a 10% screen both missed).

Verdicts:
- IMMUNE_CELLS are the cells our APIs keep free of the effect: our hash()
  of 64 bytes, a buffer lent or owned, since the x86-64 chunk-root kernel
  (#141). Any one of them judged slower at some offset: exit 1.
- CONTROL_CELLS are known to be sensitive: the upstream blake3 crate's
  hash() of 64 bytes, whose chunk path keeps its state on the stack as ours
  did. If none is judged slower, the check lost its sight of the effect:
  exit 3.
- Exit 0 otherwise; 2 when regress gave no verdict (a busy machine).
