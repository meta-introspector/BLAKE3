"""Mutation testing against a list of the mutants known to survive.

    python3 tools/mutants/check.py [--since REV] [--write] [--map] [--whole-suite]

cargo-mutants plants likely bugs in the files tools/mutants/known-<arch>.txt
names (its `files:` line), one at a time, and runs the library's and the
integration tests on each. Every mutant that survives them must be in the
list with its reason, and every listed mutant must still survive. So the
check fails on a new survivor (a missing test, or a new equivalent mutant
to list with its reason), on a listed one now caught (the list is
stale), and on a listed one whose reason is still UNCLASSIFIED. A mutant
is named by its file, function, and change, without its line: the same
change at several places in one function counts once per place. It runs
in git worktrees of HEAD of its own (SHARDS at once), so the checkout is
never mutated. A `model files:` line names the files whose mutants the
model checker judges beside the suite (tests/shuttle_*.rs: Shuttle, over
the pool's handshakes, thousands of schedules in seconds): a wait that
never ends is a deadlock it reports, not a time-out. With --write, the list is rewritten from this run, each
new mutant's reason UNCLASSIFIED and the others' kept.

A mutant whose build hashes as the unmutated build's, every test binary
alike (code_hash.py: every byte the loader maps), changes nothing this
machine runs: code for another architecture, or one the optimizer erases.
On Linux the test runner (test-runner) sees it while nextest lists the
binaries, and its first test stops at once, so it costs a build and no
test. It is a survivor of its own kind, "same code": --write gives its
row the reason SAME_REASON, and a run fails (NO LONGER SAME CODE) on a
row with that reason whose mutant now builds to other code.

A mutant whose tests no test fails, but the clock stops (nextest's, or
cargo-mutants' backstop), has an outcome of its own: it timed out. That
is neither caught nor survived: the tests did not finish, which says
nothing of what they would have found (a loop that never ends, a wait
that never returns; or a test the load made slow). Time-outs have their
own list, tools/mutants/timeouts-<arch>.txt, in KNOWN's form, and are
checked against it the same way (NEW TIME-OUT, NO LONGER TIMES OUT).
Before anything runs, every row of every architecture's lists must name a
mutant the source holds now (cargo mutants --list, which any machine reads
for every target): a row a run on older code left stops the check, named.
Exit status: 0 both lists match; 1 a survivor differs from its list (or a
reason is missing, or a row is stale); 2 only the time-outs differ (no
verdict on those).

The tests run under cargo-nextest (.config/nextest.toml), each in its own
process, a test killed at 30 s as a hang; a mutant's tests stop at the
first that fails. Every run records each test's outcome and time on every
mutant, by its place (one change at several places is a mutant at each),
and on the unmutated tree (tmp/mutants-last/<run>/tests.tsv). With
--map, every test runs on every mutant (the `mutants-map` profile, for when
the tests change), and the run weighs the tests by cost: the cheapest set
of tests that still catches every caught mutant, the tests outside it
(each a big test whose catches cheaper ones make), and the mutants only an
expensive test catches (each a small test worth writing).

With --since REV, a change's check: the mutants in the lines the change
makes (git diff REV...HEAD, cargo-mutants --in-diff), and it fails on a new
survivor among them; a listed one now caught waits for a whole run. Either
way it fails while the list names a missing test ("OPEN: a missing test"):
that is work to do, not a survivor to keep. A change that alters a test (a
line taken away inside a #[test] function, comments aside) can lose the
catches of code it leaves alone: the mutants the latest map (a --map run of
an ancestor) records that test catching, the startup self-test's aside, run
again too. A change to other test code (a helper, a test module's or
tests/'s own items), or one with no such map, runs the whole check.
