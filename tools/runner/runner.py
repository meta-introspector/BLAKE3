"""Benchmark runner for the servil fork, for the Mac's `benchrunner` account.

    sudo -u benchrunner -H python3 runner.py EXCHANGE

EXCHANGE holds `jobs/` (JSON job files, read here) and `results/` (written
here, one folder per job). Code comes from GitHub alone, at the commits a
job names. Done jobs are listed in ~/.benchrunner_done (the runner's home).
Ctrl-C stops the runner after the current job.

Jobs (commits as 7-40 hex digits; time_limit_seconds optional, default 1800,
at most 7200):

    {"type": "benchmark", "fork_commit": "...", "bench_commit": "...",
     "flags": ["--all", "--quick"], "contenders": [...], "points": [...],
     "rounds": N, "repeat": N}

(bench-hashes before its git dependency on the fork took `--thorough` for
a full run; later ones run in full by default and take `--quick`.)
    {"type": "check", "old_commit": "...", "new_commit": "...",
     "bench_commit": "...", "old_bench_commit": "...", "cells": "all", "layouts": N}

(bench-hashes check measures the cells whose code the change touches, or
every cell with "cells": "all"; "layouts" is the links a side, a pair
each, its default check's. "old_bench_commit" builds the old side with the bench at that
commit (check --old-bench), for an old side that predates the bench's
calls: 0.8 against the main line before the performance API. Every run's
samples file lands in the job's samples/.)

(Any job may add "powermetrics": true: the chip's CPU, GPU, and ANE power
every 500 ms beside it, in its results' powermetrics.txt.)
    {"type": "b3sum", "fork_commit": "...", "bench_commit": "...", "quick": true}

(A b3sum job builds the contenders, bench-hashes' tools/b3sum-contenders.py
at the fork commit: official BLAKE3's b3sum, the fork's as b3sum and
b3sum-1-thread, the system's sum programs; and runs bench-hashes b3sum on
the files in ~/b3sum-bench-files, made there once. The report, samples
and map land in the job's benchmark-results/. "quick" runs the small set.)
    {"type": "example", "example": "scaling" | "host_lab" | "energy_probe" | "job_trace",
     "fork_commit": "...", "args": ["message", "1048576"]}
    {"type": "test", "fork_commit": "..."}

(A test job runs the fork's suites natively, under cargo-nextest: the
library tests, the doc tests, the
integration tests in tests/ (the planned API's contract), and the
official vectors.)

(A benchmark job may add "train": [W_MS, S] and "nonstop_visits": N, the
continuous-load proposal's tests: bench-hashes' --train and
--nonstop-visits.)

(A benchmark job with "repeat": N runs the benchmark N times back to
back, run i's files in run-i/, for calibrations.)

Each result folder holds runner.log (every command and its output),
verdict.json, and the job's own files: the benchmark's report, graph,
and samples; host_lab's report.

The checkouts persist between jobs (CHECKOUTS: the fork, and bench-hashes
beside it), moved to each job's commits with a forced checkout that
rewrites only the files that differ, so Cargo rebuilds only what changed:
the fork's target directory serves test and example jobs, check's
sides (target/check/ in the fork) its jobs, and bench-hashes' own build
against the fork as it is (`bench-hashes build-against`) benchmark jobs.
