"""Prove the instruction models equal to Arm's own specification.

For each register form the proofs use (cross_check.py's list), Isla runs the
instruction on Arm's architecture model (Sail's Armv9.4, as an Isla
snapshot) and gives every path through it: the registers it reads, the
values it writes, and the path's conditions, in SMT. Each trace becomes one
Z3 query: its definitions and conditions, and Isla's written value
differing from the model's on the same inputs (aarch64.py, vector.py). Every
query unsatisfiable proves the model equal to Arm's specification for every
input on which the instruction completes (a path that takes an exception,
such as a trap the system configures, runs no instruction). Expressions Z3
cannot read (the system state's enumerations and structs) are left out of
the conditions, which can only make a query harder to prove; an unreadable
written value fails the form. A vector register is compared in its 128
bits, the V register the NEON instructions write; a flag in PSTATE's
1-bit field, and a condition the inputs leave open (csel, ccmp, cset) on
each of its two sides.

    python3 tools/verify/isla_check.py

Needs Isla (github.com/rems-project/isla, `isla-footprint`), the Armv9.4
snapshot (isla-snapshots, `armv9p4.ir`), and Isla's source (its
configurations), named by ISLA_FOOTPRINT, ISLA_SNAPSHOT, and ISLA; and
LLVM's assembler (LLVM_MC).

The snapshot runs with Sail's later fix of one library function applied
(`write_snapshot`). Isla gives no trace for tbl (an index read from data):
that form stays checked against the CPU alone (cross_check.py).

The SME2 kernels' streaming register forms (cross_check_sme.py's list)
run in streaming mode with ZA enabled (`write_streaming_config`): all
sixteen lanes of a Z register, and ZA's tiles cell by cell, each ZA form
at the slice base its register holds in the kernels. The predicated add
and cmphi (Isla runs a path per predicate, or none), and the ZA loads and
stores (memory forms), are left to cross_check_sme.py. The four moves into
tile 1's vertical slices need more than 50 GB of memory in Isla, and fail
on a machine with less.
