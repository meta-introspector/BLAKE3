# Proofs of the compression code

These tools compare assembled kernels with the compression function of the
Lean specification of BLAKE3 (`c2sp/BLAKE3/`). A completed case covers every
input, key, counter, and flags value under its harness's contract.

The AArch64 proofs need Python 3 with Z3 (`python3-z3`), an AArch64
machine with the SHA-3 extension, and Clang and llvm-objdump 17 or later
(for SME2). The project's VM runs them (`long-proofs.sh`); the SME2
cross-check needs an SME2 CPU (Apple M4, or the VM on it). The x86-64
proofs run on any machine with Python 3, `python3-z3`, Clang and LLVM's
`ld.lld`.

**Coverage.** The hybrid kernels at every block count they take (1 to
16; the q kernels' partial chunk at every block count), those without
SHA-3 (kn, pn) among them, and the extended-output kernels (x1, x4, x8: each
lane's whole 64-byte output). The SME2 kernels
at the 512-bit streaming vector length (`cntw` = 16, which they check
themselves), for one and two groups, the last group storing 1, 15, or
all 16 values; the SME2 kernel with an integer lane
(`c/blake3_sme2_hybrid_aarch64.S`: 16 SME2 lanes and 2 integer ones a
group) for one and two groups, and the message kernel at every message length of 2 to 16
blocks with the last block of any length. The chunk kernel at every group
count up to 2^40 groups, its last group storing all 16 values, by
induction over its group loop (`prove_sme2.py every`, 2 minutes), its
block loop by its own proof as the message kernel's (below): each
lane's bytes are an array, so a group that read another group's chunk
would compute other terms. The
parent kernel the same way (`parents_every`, under a minute), with every
input byte independent across groups. It preloads the next group's pairs
into ZA; the invariant states those bytes at group K's addresses and checks
its initial state and successor.
The extended-output kernel (`xof_every`, under a minute), and the message
kernel at every group count and every length of 2 to 16 blocks in one
induction (`messages_every`, about 2 minutes, `prove_block_loop.py`): its
block loop is proved once, a pass for every pass K and every length (from
any hash state, with block K in ZA, the standard's compression of block K,
block K + 1 then in ZA), and the group loop's proof takes the loop by that
proof, its entry checked (the key; each lane's block 0 in ZA). Messages
are arrays read at any offset there, so a group that read another
group's bytes would compute other terms. The kernel with an integer lane
the same way (`x2_every`, about 12 minutes, `prove_hybrid_loop.py`): its
integer units hash chunk 16 in the block loop's passes 0 to 7 and chunk
17 in passes 8 to 15, two blocks a pass, so its block loop is proved in
two halves, each one pass for every pass of the half; the group loop's
proof takes the loop by them, its whole entry state checked (the key,
each SME2 chunk's block 0, the table, counter and output of the group).

## What a proof shows

For each kernel and block count, `prove_hybrid.py` assembles the file,
takes the kernel's instructions from objdump's disassembly of the object
(what the CPU runs, macros expanded), and executes them symbolically
(`aarch64.py`, `vector.py`): registers and memory hold Z3 terms over the
inputs, pointers are (region, offset) pairs. The run checks:

- **The result**: each output word equals the specification's
  (`lean_spec.py`, from the Lean specification), compared in a normal form
  (`canon.py`) that sorts sums and xors, folds each one's constants and
  parameters into one term wherever its operands came from, keeps
  rotations, and undoes the byte and lane shuffles of loads, stores,
  spills, and transposes; small terms without rounds in them (the
  counter's halves, the flag words) go to Z3's solver. Equal normal forms mean equal terms; a mismatch is a
  failed proof, never a false one.
- **Memory**: every access stays inside the buffer the kernel's contract
  gives it (inputs, key, out, the pointer table) or inside the stack frame
  it allocated; nothing is read from the stack before it is written; read-
  only buffers are never written.
- **Control flow and addresses**: a branch, a select, an address, or a
  table index that depends on symbols outside the harness's declared
  public parameters stops the proof. Input bytes and keys stay secret in
  these checks. Some induction harnesses also declare counters and counter
  steps public, so their trace claim includes that assumption.
- **The calling convention**: callee-saved registers (x19-x29, d8-d15)
  and sp come back unchanged, and the kernel returns through x30.

## What it rests on

- **The definition**: the compression function of the Lean specification,
  `c2sp/BLAKE3/Blake3.lean`, which is generated from C2SP's `BLAKE3.md` and
  checked against all of it (its README). `lean/Generic.lean` holds the
  same generated text over any word type; `lean/Bridge.lean` proves, in
  Lean's kernel, that at 32-bit words it is the specification's
  `BLAKE3_COMPRESS`; `lean/Sound.lean` proves that the symbolic terms it
  computes (`symbolic`) evaluate, under each node's meaning on 32-bit words
  (`Term.eval`), to the specification's `BLAKE3_COMPRESS` of the inputs.
  `lean/Emit.lean` writes those terms as a graph, `lean/compress.json`, and
  `lean_spec.py` reads each node as Z3's operation of the same meaning; the
  printer and the reader (some 40 lines) are checked together against the
  specification's own outputs at sample inputs (`lean/emit.py`).

- **The instruction models** (`aarch64.py`, `vector.py`, `sme.py`), each
  a few lines following the Arm architecture reference manual.
  `cross_check.py` and `cross_check_sme.py` run every register form the
  kernels use (83 NEON and integer, 73 streaming, ZA moves, slice loads
  and stores, and predicates among them), with their own immediates, on
  the CPU and in the model over random states. The SME2 check found one
  model error: a four-register ZA move rounds its slice base down to a
  multiple of four (the kernels use aligned bases, so no proof was
  affected); the model now does too. `isla_check.py` proves the models
  equal to Arm's own specification (Sail's Armv9.4, run by Isla) for every
  input on every path that completes: the general registers, the flags,
  and a NEON register's 128 bits. It checks 85 of the 86 forms the
  kernels use, the flag-setting and conditional ones among them; Isla's
  symbolic run stops inside Arm's specification for `tbl` with one table
  register, which stays checked against the CPU. It then plants
  model errors and requires each rejected: a carry computed as `>`, `hi`
  ignoring Z, `xar` (NEON and streaming) and a shifted `eor` rotated one
  place off, `dup` reading the wrong lane, a ZA move into the wrong tile.
  The snapshot runs with Sail's later fix of `unsigned_subrange`
  (rems-project/sail 1f8f173), which the check applies itself. Without
  it, the snapshot reads `dup`'s element index as `imm5[4]`
  ([Isla #107](https://github.com/rems-project/isla/issues/107)). It
  needs Isla's source (`ISLA`), `isla-footprint` (`ISLA_FOOTPRINT`),
  the Armv9.4 snapshot (`ISLA_SNAPSHOT`), and LLVM's assembler (`LLVM_MC`):
  Isla `e9b5d94`, isla-snapshots `d8b3101`, whose snapshot archive's
  SHA-256 is `d8c547eefd125a8bd01a827d2733fc9eddbc415839e8d278310e527c7721a3db`.
  The SME2 kernels' streaming register forms run the same way in
  streaming mode, all 16 lanes and ZA cell by cell, each ZA move at the
  slice base its register holds in the kernels: 19 of 23 agree. The four
  moves into tile 1's vertical slices exhaust Isla's memory (98 GB, as do
  single-register writes into ZA); they, the predicated `add`, `cmphi`,
  and the ZA loads and stores stay checked against the CPU. Memory effects
  are outside it.
- **objdump's disassembly** of the assembled object, and the assembler.
- **The contracts as the harnesses state them**: the input buffers apart
  from each other and from `out` (c1 also with `out` equal to `key`, as
  `compress_in_place` calls it), `packed` with zero upper bits, and the
  q kernels' table layout (`prove_partial`). A caller that breaks them
  is outside the proof; the Rust callers are covered by tests.

**Induction** (`induction.py`): two successive arrivals at a loop's head are
generalized into one state at a symbolic iteration K (positions equal in
both kept, those that differ by a constant written start + K x difference,
the rest unknown); every path from that state is run, the run splitting
where a branch on the lengths is open, and each must return to the head in
the state for K + 1, its iteration's output right and nothing else
written, or leave the loop with all its output right. Only symbols declared
as lengths may steer a branch or an address, so a branch on data still
stops a proof; equalities of lengths are proved under the path's
assumptions.

Not proved here: the library's Rust (the dispatch, the tree walk, the
Hasher, the threads), which the tests cover.

## The x86-64 kernels

`x86.py` models the instructions the x86-64 kernels use, on the same
executor as the AArch64 model (a fault on an access outside a region, the
calling convention checked). The writable stack ends at the return slot
and the actual stack arguments. Each proof uses one
symbolic entry-stack residue: 8, 24, 40 or 56 modulo 64, the four legal
ABI alignments. Vector memory forms enforce the alignment their encoding
requires; buffer bases carry the alignment their contract promises.
Addresses and memory masks use declared public parameters, prefetch
addresses included. `cross_check_x86.py` runs every vector form from the
kernels on the CPU and by the model, on random states;
memory forms also compare the whole buffer, and aligned forms get a
bounded unaligned-address fault control. AVX-512 forms need an AVX-512
CPU and are reported skipped without one (CI's `x86_model` job).

`prove_x86.py` proves these cases against the same Lean specification,
390 in all (`--representative` runs 203 of them: every block length,
the first, full-width and two-pass counts, the pair shape, and the wide
kernels):

- `compress_in_place` and `compress_xof` for SSE4.1 and AVX-512, under
  the System V convention of Linux and macOS, as every case below;
- `hash_many` at every count up to two passes of the kernel's width at
  1, 2 and 16 blocks with an incrementing counter, and at every block
  length at one full-width pass with one counter, for each instruction
  set;
- `hash_many` with two inputs at consecutive counters over 1 to 15
  blocks, on AVX2 and AVX-512: `pair.rs`'s shape, a
  whole chunk and a partial one side by side;
- AVX-512 `xof_many` at 1 to 32 blocks, the count per call the crate
  makes;
- the chunk-root kernel's SSE4.1 and AVX-512 entries
  (`c/blake3_chunk_root_x86-64_unix.S`) at 0 to 15 whole blocks before
  the last, so every input of a chunk or less, for every last-block
  length and mode flags with CHUNK_START clear, the kernel's contract.
  From four blocks its output masks are selects whose condition the
  path's lengths settle; the normal form takes such a select as the arm
  it selects;
- the partial pass (`c/blake3_partial_x86-64_unix.S`, SSE4.1 and AVX2)
  at every block after which its snapshot is taken: each
  lane's sixteen blocks from its chaining value and counter, with every
  per-lane, per-block length and flags;
- the wide kernels (`c/blake3_avx512_32.S`, generated by
  `tools/gen_avx512_32.py`): k32 (32 inputs at counters counter + i), p32
  (32 inputs at one counter) and p16 (16 inputs at one counter), each at 1
  to 16 blocks, for every input byte, key, counter, flags and last-block
  length, in the AArch64 kernel family's ABI (48 cases). A 32-input case
  holds up to 22 GB, so `main` runs them three at a time.

`prove_x86_loop.py` proves `hash_many` at every input count, with the
same executor and induction helper: 51 cases, fixed counters at block
lengths 1 to 16 and incrementing counters at 16 blocks, each on SSE4.1,
AVX2 and AVX-512 (the shapes the crate calls). Each
case covers zero inputs, every full-width pass and every remainder, up to
the largest count whose output and pointer table fit 64-bit regions.
Every input has its own read-only region and independent words; keys,
counters and flags stay arbitrary, and counters keep their carries.
A case can take gigabytes; set
the process's memory limit (`ulimit -v 6291456`) and choose `--workers`
from the host's memory. `--help` describes the command; with no case list
it runs the whole matrix, which `cases()` enumerates in one place.

## Extending

An instruction the models lack stops a proof with "instruction not
modelled"; add it to `aarch64.py` (scalar) or `vector.py` (NEON), then to
`cross_check.py`'s coverage by running it (it finds every form itself). A
new kernel needs a harness stating its contract (`prove_table`,
`prove_partial`, `prove_c1` are the patterns) and a line in `cases`.

Lessons the tools were built on:
- Cache Z3 terms by id only while holding them: ids are reused, and a
  stale entry could equate different terms.
- Give each proof case a fresh process: the caches grow, and 16 workers
  in one ran the VM out of memory. A worker that exits without a result
  makes the runner kill and reap its pending workers before reporting the
  failed case; Python would otherwise wait for them at interpreter exit.
  Keep whole-job process-group supervision for subprocess descendants.
- A harness that hands every group the same symbols can prove a kernel
  that never advances its pointer: give each group's data its own
  offset, and check that every read lies in the current group's region
  (a kernel that preloads the next group then fails the check: the
  proof may be incomplete, never unsound).
- Plant a mutant in each step of a loop the induction proves (its
  pointers, its counter) and see the proof reject it. `mutants.py` plants,
  beside an unmodified positive control of each: in the SME2 kernels, a
  group loop's counter and pointer steps, a parent kernel's input and
  output strides, and a block loop's offset step and a rotation after it;
  in the AVX2 kernel, its strides, its counter's direction, a loop that
  never ends, and a read past an input; four x86 memory controls (a write
  into the caller's stack, an aligned load of an unaligned buffer, a
  prefetch address derived from a secret, a masked store); and four
  chunk-root controls (a wrong input stride, CHUNK_START never set,
  CHUNK_END dropped, half the output unwritten). Only
  `Unproved` counts as a rejection; an exception inside the checker stops
  the run.
