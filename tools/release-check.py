"""The release checklist's mechanical steps, read from where each gate
left its result, for one commit (CONTRIBUTING.md, "Releases").

    python3 tools/release-check.py [COMMIT]        # default: servil's tip

It runs nothing heavy. For each step it reads the evidence the gate
wrote and prints one line: PASS, FAIL, OPEN (no evidence yet, with the
command that makes it), or, each its own outcome, TIMED OUT (the gate, or
GitHub's answer here, ran out of time) and NO VERDICT (the gate could not
judge: a check whose machine was busy). Exit status 0 only when every step
passes; 1 when a step failed or is open; 2 when every other step passes
and the rest timed out or have no verdict.

- CI: a workflow_dispatch run on the commit (every job succeeded).
  Pull-request runs check a synthetic merge by default, not the head SHA
  GitHub associates with the run, so they are not release evidence.
- Long proofs: the commit's GitHub status "long proofs" (long-proofs.sh).
- Mac check: runner/results/*/verdict.json whose job names this commit as
  new_commit and the previous release as old_commit (a "check" job with
  "cells": "all"), run on AC power from start to end (its verdict's "power
  at start" and "power at end"); on battery it is NO VERDICT.
- The logs, each named for the commit it ran on (C: the commit's first 12
  hex digits), so an earlier commit's log cannot stand in for it:
  - VM check: tmp/night/check-release-vm-C.log, from
    `cd ../bench-hashes && cargo run --release -- check --fork <this checkout> --against <previous tag> --cells all`,
    with `--old-bench <bench commit>` when the old side predates the
    bench's calls (0.8: 5be5f236, the old API's bench), as in the Mac
    job's "old_bench_commit".
  - Full mutation run: tmp/night/mutants-C.log with both final summaries
    matching their survivor and timeout lists, from
    `python3 tools/mutants/check.py` with the commit checked out.
  - check-builds: tmp/night/check-builds-C.log ending "every build passes".
  - Publish dry run: tmp/night/publish-dry-run-C.log, from the paired
    package dry-run in CONTRIBUTING.md, followed by "publish-dry-run: ok"
    only on success.
- The pages: README.md, QUALITY.md, CHANGELOG.md changed since the
  previous release (a release rewrites them for its readers).

The previous release is the nearest reachable v* tag, excluding tags on
this candidate itself. Creating the release's tag must not make the check
compare the release against itself; tags on other branches are irrelevant.
The first release has none: its checks run against the main line before
the release's changes (the commit the release's tracking issue names),
and its pages are read fresh rather than diffed.
