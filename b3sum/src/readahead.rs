//! Many files at once (Linux): b3sum keeps up to DEPTH files read from
//! storage in flight across its file threads, where it kept one a thread.
//!
//! Each small file (a regular file reporting under `SMALL` bytes) is
//! opened, its reported size taken as a hint for the buffer's first length,
//! then read with preadv2(RWF_NOWAIT), which succeeds only from the page
//! cache: a cached file is read and hashed at once. A file that misses is
//! advised (posix_fadvise WILLNEED, which starts its reads from storage and
//! returns) and set aside; once the thread holds its batch of such files,
//! it reads and hashes each in turn, by which time the reads have arrived
//! or are on the way. Every file is read to its end, whatever size it
//! reports (/proc reports 0 bytes, /sys 4096, and a file may grow while it
//! is read): the size affects how b3sum reads, never what it hashes.
//! Larger files and other kinds of file go to `hash_path`, as before.
//!
//! Measured (bench-hashes-validation/b3sum-uring): from storage, 1000 files
//! of 16 KiB with one thread took 0.27 of today's time, with 20 threads 0.86
//! (there the drive's random reads set the pace, about 110,000 a second);
//! cached files cost what they did. Tried and dropped: io_uring with 4 reads
//! in flight a thread (as fast as the hint with a ring and a dependency), a
//! stream a thread with Stream::submit_reader (slower cached: x1.18-1.35),
//! O_DIRECT for files that miss (x1.27-1.85 from storage: one read a thread
//! at a time, and no readahead), advising every file without RWF_NOWAIT
//! first (WILLNEED walks a cached file's pages: x1.07-1.17 for one thread).
